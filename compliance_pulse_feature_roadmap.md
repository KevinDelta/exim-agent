## üß© MVP (Weeks 1 ‚Äì 4)

**Goal:** Deliver SKU + lane‚Äìaware compliance snapshots and weekly digests.

| Category | Feature | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Data & Models** | SKU + Lane Data Model | Define `ClientProfile`, `SkuRef`, `LaneRef`, and `ComplianceEvent`. |
|  | Watchlist Storage | Persist client SKUs and lanes in mem0. |
|  | Basic Normalization | Fetch & normalize HTS, OFAC/CSL, FDA, FSIS, CROSS data. |
| **Pipelines (ZenML)** | `fetch_normalize_index` | Daily ingestion pipeline for SKU/lane data. |
|  | `weekly_pulse` | Weekly diff + summary generator. |
| **Retrieval & Reasoning** | Chroma Collections | Embed policy/ruling text tagged by SKU + lane. |
|  | LangGraph Nodes | Tools: `search_hts`, `screen_parties`, `fetch_refusals`, `find_rulings`. |
|  | Agentic Summaries | Generate ‚Äúwhat changed + why it matters‚Äù for SKU/lane pairs. |
| **API Layer (FastAPI)** | `/snapshot` | Return single SKU+lane snapshot with citations. |
|  | `/pulse/{client_id}/weekly` | Weekly digest JSON by SKU + lane. |
|  | `/ask` | Ad-hoc reasoning endpoint (‚ÄúWhat changed for HTS 8517 China‚ÜíUS lane?‚Äù). |
| **UI (Next.js)** | Snapshot Card | 5 tiles (HTS, FTA, Sanctions, Health/Safety, Rulings). |
|  | Weekly Digest View | Displays grouped updates per lane. |
| **Ops & Governance** | API Key Auth | Basic authentication. |
|  | Logging & Metrics | Track latency, coverage, errors. |

‚úÖ **Deliverable:** A fully working MVP producing lane-specific compliance snapshots and automated weekly digests for 10‚Äì50 SKUs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è V1 (Weeks 5 ‚Äì 8)

**Goal:** Add deeper reasoning, personalization, and collaborative delivery.

| Category | Feature | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Memory & Personalization** | Preference Learning | mem0 stores client thresholds (e.g., duty delta ‚â• 1%). |
|  | Dismissal Memory | Remember suppressed or false alerts. |
| **Advanced Reasoning** | Change Context Delta | Compare prior week‚Äôs data per lane; classify ‚Äúnew‚Äù, ‚Äúresolved‚Äù, ‚Äúescalated‚Äù. |
|  | Causal Insights | ‚ÄúWhy did this change occur?‚Äù (ruling update, tariff revision, refusal trend). |
| **Workflow Automation** | Slack / Email Digest | Send formatted digest summaries automatically. |
|  | CSV / JSON Exports | For BI dashboards or internal tools. |
| **Frontend Enhancements** | Lane Heatmap | Visualize active lanes and risk levels. |
|  | Multi-SKU Compare | Side-by-side view of SKUs on the same lane. |
| **Compliance Coverage** | Add FTA Rules | Pull FTA origin requirements via public datasets. |
|  | Sanctions Delta Tracking | Track changes to restricted party lists over time. |
| **Pipeline Scaling** | ZenML Monitoring | Model-run metrics + alerts on data drift. |
| **Security & Audit** | Audit Trail | Timestamped record of alerts and decisions. |

‚úÖ **Deliverable:** Multi-lane reporting and agentic weekly briefs ready for pilot clients.
