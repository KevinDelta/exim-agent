# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating answers.

## How RAG Works

1. **Document Ingestion**: Documents are processed, split into chunks, and converted into embeddings
2. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are stored in a vector database like ChromaDB or Pinecone
3. **Query Processing**: User questions are converted into embeddings
4. **Retrieval**: Similar documents are retrieved using vector similarity search
5. **Generation**: The LLM generates responses using retrieved context

## Benefits of RAG

- **Up-to-date Information**: Access to recent documents without retraining models
- **Reduced Hallucination**: Grounded responses based on actual documents
- **Cost-Effective**: No need for fine-tuning large models
- **Transparency**: Can cite sources and show retrieved documents
- **Domain-Specific**: Easy to add specialized knowledge

## RAG with LangChain v1

LangChain v1 makes implementing RAG straightforward:

- Document loaders for various formats
- Text splitters for intelligent chunking
- Vector store integrations
- Retriever tools for agents
- Built-in RAG chains and templates

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate chunk sizes (1024-2048 tokens)
- Include chunk overlap (10-20%)
- Choose good embedding models (e.g., text-embedding-3-small)
- Implement reranking for better retrieval quality
- Monitor retrieval relevance scores
