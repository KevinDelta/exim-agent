      "- Duty-free access to the U.S. market for eligible products from AGOA-eligible sub-Saharan African countries (including goods covered under AGOA and GSP).\n",
      "\n",
      "- This has supported substantial trade with the United States, with AGOA imports totaling about $10.3 billion in 2022 (and non-oil AGOA imports of $5.7 billion), indicating strong market access and growth potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "- It has encouraged diversification into non-oil sectors, with notable gains in apparel, auto parts, macadamia nuts, jewelry, fresh oranges, and footwear.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The program covers key import categories such as Mineral Fuels, Transportation Equipment, Textiles and Apparel, Agricultural Products, Minerals/Metals, and Jewelry.\n",

      "- What it is: A list of goods and technologies that have both civilian/scientific use and potential military or security applications, used to regulate how they are developed, produced, or transferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "- How it’s organized:\n",
      "  - It is divided into categories (e.g., Category 1, Category 4 for computers, Category 5 Part 1, Category 5 Part 2). Some categories may have items listed, while others show none.\n",
      "  - Within categories, specific items and types of technology are named, including materials, hardware, software, and “technology” descriptions that relate to development, production, or use.\n",

      "Query: What is PVoC and how does it apply to Kenya?\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "PVoC stands for Pre-Verification of Conformity. It is a mandatory conformity-assessment regime for imports into Kenya, administered by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) since 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key points:\n",
      "- Purpose: Verify that products destined for Kenya meet Kenya Standards, approved equivalents, and other regulations before shipment.\n",
      "- How it works: The verification, inspection, and testing are carried out in the country of export (the exporting country). A certificate of conformity (CoC) is issued if goods conform; a nonconformity report (NCR) is issued for nonconforming goods.\n",
      "- What is checked: Physical inspection before shipment, sampling, testing in accredited laboratories, auditing of production processes, and documentary checks.\n",
      "- Route A (consignment inspection and testing): All products under this route must be tested and inspected. Containerized cargo must be sealed and CoC details provided. Several high-risk product groups are eligible for Route A, including:\n",
      "  - Animal and fishery products (fresh/frozen)\n",
      "  - Bulk petroleum products and base oils\n",
      "  - Bulk cereals and pulses (rice, wheat, beans, maize)\n",
      "  - Edible cooking oils\n",
      "  - Electrical cables\n",
      "  - Fertilizer\n",
      "  - Fresh dairy products\n",
      "- Administration and impact: KEBS contracts inspection agencies, with cooperation reviewed every three years. Agencies are assigned specific zones, which can cause delays for importers awaiting an inspector. The program aims to facilitate Kenya’s acceptance of goods and reduce non-tariff barriers, aligning with the move away from the prior pre-shhipment regime.\n",

      "\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "Query: Summarize US trade with sub-Saharan Africa\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "- Overall pattern: The United States engages in a sizable, yet fluctuating, goods-trade relationship with sub-Saharan Africa, with imports consistently larger than exports and a persistent trade deficit that has varied in size over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Trade size and direction (2002–2022):\n",
      "  - Total goods trade rose from about $24 billion in 2002 to a peak around $105 billion in 2007, then fluctuated and settled near $50 billion in 2022.\n",
      "  - U.S. exports of goods to the region grew from about $6.0 billion in 2002 to roughly $18.5 billion in 2022.\n",
      "  - U.S. imports of goods from the region grew from about $17.9 billion in 2002 to about $31.4 billion in 2022.\n",
      "  - The trade balance has remained negative, ranging from -$11.9 billion in 2002 to -$12.8 billion in 2022, with a notable peak deficit of around -$67.5 billion in 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "- AGOA trade (as a driver of access, including GSP):\n",
      "  - In 2022, AGOA imports totaled $10.3 billion, up about 26% from the act’s first full year and consistent with recent averages.\n",
      "  - Petroleum products accounted for about 45% of AGOA imports.\n",
      "  - Non-oil AGOA imports reached a record $5.7 billion in 2022.\n",
      "  - Leading beneficiaries include South Africa (largest), Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, and Angola.\n",
      "  - Top AGOA import categories in 2022 were Mineral Fuels ($4.6B), Transportation Equipment ($1.5B), Textiles and Apparel ($1.4B), Agricultural Products ($914M), Minerals/Metals and Related Products ($755M), and Jewelry/Precious Stones ($420M).\n",
      "  - Apparel imports under AGOA also rose over time, while other sectors showed mixed trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Key takeaways:\n",
      "  - The relationship covers diverse sectors, with energy (oil/fuels) and transportation equipment being prominent in AGOA-related imports.\n",
      "  - South Africa stands out as the largest beneficiary within AGOA, with other countries contributing notably in oil, apparel, and other goods.\n",
      "  - While trade volumes fluctuate, the United States consistently runs a trade deficit with sub-Saharan Africa, though the AGOA framework has helped expand non-oil imports and diversify the mix.\n",

      "User: What is AGOA?\n",
      "Assistant: AGOA stands for the African Growth and Opportunity Act. It is a U.S. trade statute designed to promote economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa by giving eligible African countries preferential access to the U.S. market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key points:\n",
      "- It provides duty-free or reduced-duty treatment for a wide range of products from eligible countries (often combined with the Generalized System of Preferences, or GSP, benefits).\n",
      "- Countries are designated as AGOA beneficiaries; the list is reviewed and updated annually (for 2025, 32 sub-Saharan African countries were designated).\n",
      "- The President can terminate eligibility or suspend/withdraw duty-free treatment for specific goods if a country does not meet the requirements.\n",
      "- An AGOA subcommittee (AGOA TPSC Subcommittee) handles the annual eligibility review and related procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "User: What are its main benefits?\n",
      "Assistant: Here are the main benefits of AGOA (the African Growth and Opportunity Act):\n",
      "\n",
      "- Tariff preferences: Eligible African countries receive duty-free or reduced-duty access to a wide range of U.S. goods, making African products more price-competitive in the U.S. market.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Market expansion and diversification: AGOA encourages exporters to diversify beyond traditional commodities by opening up opportunities in manufactured goods, agro-processing, textiles, and other sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Investment and job creation: Preferential access to the U.S. market can attract investment in Africa, helping to create jobs and develop local industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Regional value chains and industrial development: The program’s rules of origin are designed to promote regional manufacturing and the development of domestic value chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Trade capacity building and assistance: AGOA includes technical assistance, capacity-building programs, and support to help beneficiary countries meet U.S. standards and take advantage of the preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Predictable, rules-based framework: Eligibility decisions are reviewed annually, providing a stable, transparent framework for trade planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Complement to other preferences: AGOA works alongside the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to broaden preferential access for sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Governance incentives: Countries must meet certain eligibility criteria (e.g., reforms, anti-corruption, worker rights) to maintain benefits, encouraging governance improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like, I can tailor this to a specific country or sector (e.g., textiles, agriculture) and give examples of what’s eligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "User: Which countries are eligible?\n",
      "Assistant: The list of AGOA-eligible countries is not fixed—it's determined each year by the USTR after the annual eligibility review. For 2026, the eligible countries are those Sub-Saharan African countries designated as AGOA beneficiaries in the AGOA Annual Review for Calendar Year 2026.\n",
