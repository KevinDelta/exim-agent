# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for transforming the existing RAG application into a comprehensive **Compliance Intelligence Platform**. The platform will provide automated compliance monitoring, risk assessment, and intelligent insights for import/export operations, leveraging the existing LangGraph, ChromaDB, mem0, and ZenML foundation.

## Glossary

- **Compliance_Platform**: The enhanced system providing automated compliance monitoring and intelligence
- **SKU_Monitor**: Component that tracks compliance status for specific product SKUs
- **Lane_Tracker**: Component that monitors trade lanes (origin-destination-mode combinations)
- **Risk_Engine**: AI-powered component that assesses and scores compliance risks
- **Intelligence_Agent**: LangGraph-based agent that reasons about compliance data
- **Snapshot_Generator**: Component that creates point-in-time compliance status reports
- **Alert_System**: Component that generates and delivers compliance notifications
- **Citation_Engine**: Component that tracks and validates data sources and evidence
- **Client_Portal**: Web interface for accessing compliance intelligence
- **Data_Pipeline**: ZenML-based system for ingesting and processing compliance data
